Welcome to Ewancoder Arch Linux's documentation!
************************************************

**Ewancoder Arch Linux installation script** is useful tool for installing/reinstalling your arch linux distro with all software automatically setting up (from your github dotfiles). While I were writing this script only for my needs - I named it for myself, but if I'm going to share it to everybody - it looks like the name is gonna change. So, although, name **EAL** can refer not only to **Ewancoder Arch Linux** but to **Effective & Easy Arch Linux** installation script.
